# Vacation-announcement-tool
This is the Python code for one of my projects during 2nd rotation of DTLP program.   
The aim of the project is to create a tool to automate the manual **vacation announcement procedure**.   
The project automates the process of necessary Excel files generation and Outlook letter generation.  
    
The code uses _**pandas**_ library to work with Excel files, and _**win32**_ library to work with Outlook.
## Prerequisites for running the code && creating an executable file
#### Python installation
Installation of Python itself should be fairly straight-forward.
* Download and execute the latest Python 3.6.1 installation package from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-361/)
* Put a tick when asked whether to add python path as environment variable
* Verify a successful installation by opening a command prompt window by typing `python` to open Python interpreter
