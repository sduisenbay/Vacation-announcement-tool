# Vacation-announcement-tool
This is the Python code for one of my projects during 2nd rotation of DTLP program.   
The aim of the project is to create a tool to automate the vacation announcement procedure performed manually by HR employees.   
The project automates the process of necessary Excel files generation and Outlook letter generation.  
    
The code uses _**pandas**_ library to work with Excel files, and _**win32**_ to work with Outlook.
## Prerequisites for running the code && creating an executable file
The code is written and tested on [Python-3.6.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-361/)
