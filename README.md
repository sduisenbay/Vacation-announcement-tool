# Vacation-announcement-tool
This is the Python code for one of my projects during 2nd rotation of DTLP program.   
The aim of the project is to create a tool to automate the vacation announcement procedure performed manually by HR employees.   
The project automates the process of necessary Excel files generation and Outlook letter generation.  
    
The code uses *pandas* library to work with Excel files, and *win32* to work with Outlook.
